# CI Hanging Issue - Resolution Guide

## Problem
GitHub Actions workflow was stuck in "checks running" state due to hanging tests in CI environment.

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow was still using:
- `yarn` commands (after migrating to npm)
- Old test configuration that could hang in CI
- Insufficient timeout settings for CI environment

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)

**Before:**
```yaml
- name: Use Node ${{ matrix.node }}
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
    cache: 'yarn'

- name: Install dependencies ðŸ“¦
  run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline

- name: Test ðŸ§ª
  run: yarn test --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2
```

**After:**
```yaml
- name: Use Node ${{ matrix.node }}
  uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
    cache: 'npm'

- name: Install dependencies ðŸ“¦
  run: npm ci

- name: Test ðŸ§ª
  run: npm run test:coverage
  env:
    CI: true
```

### 2. Enhanced Vitest Configuration for CI

**Added CI-specific settings:**
```typescript
testTimeout: process.env.CI ? 10000 : 5000, // Longer timeout in CI
hookTimeout: process.env.CI ? 10000 : 5000,
teardownTimeout: process.env.CI ? 10000 : 5000,
reporter: process.env.CI ? ['text', 'json'] : ['text'],
```

### 3. Package Manager Migration Complete

- âœ… Removed `yarn.lock`
- âœ… Generated `package-lock.json`
- âœ… Updated all workflow commands to use `npm`
- âœ… Added `CI: true` environment variable

## Expected Behavior

After these changes, your GitHub Actions should:
1. **Install faster**: `npm ci` is faster than `yarn install` in CI
2. **Run tests**: Complete in ~10-15 seconds instead of timing out
3. **Generate coverage**: Produce both text and JSON coverage reports
4. **Exit cleanly**: No hanging or infinite waits

## Verification Commands

Test locally with CI simulation:
```bash
# Simulate CI environment
CI=true npm run test:coverage

# Test with timeout
timeout 30 npm run test:coverage
```

## If Still Hanging

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs** for specific error messages
2. **Cancel running workflows** and try again
3. **Use workflow_dispatch** to manually trigger tests
4. **Check for resource limits** in GitHub Actions

### Manual Trigger Workflow
Add this to your workflow file if needed:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, master]
  workflow_dispatch: # Allows manual triggering
```

## Emergency CI Bypass

If you need to bypass CI temporarily:
```yaml
# Add this step to skip tests in emergency
- name: Skip tests (emergency)
  run: echo "Tests skipped for emergency deployment"
  if: contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip-tests]')
```

Then commit with: `git commit -m "fix: emergency fix [skip-tests]"`

## Monitoring

- **Normal CI run**: Should complete in 2-5 minutes
- **Test phase**: Should complete in 10-15 seconds
- **Coverage**: Should be generated and saved as artifacts

## Key Changes Summary

1. **Package Manager**: yarn â†’ npm
2. **Test Command**: `yarn test --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2` â†’ `npm run test:coverage`
3. **Caching**: `cache: 'yarn'` â†’ `cache: 'npm'`
4. **Environment**: Added `CI: true` environment variable
5. **Timeouts**: Increased for CI environment (10 seconds vs 5 seconds)
6. **Reporting**: Enhanced coverage reporting in CI

Your "checks running" issue should now be resolved!
